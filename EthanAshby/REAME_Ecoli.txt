Hello! This Github folder contains all the data and code needed to produce a
writeup (E.coli_final_analysis.pdf) which details the analysis of the timing of E. coli 
gene expression in response to cell starvation. Gene expression timing analysis is
conducted through sigmoidal models fit through the ImpulseDE2 package. The properties of
these sigmoidal models are first assessed through simulations, and then are applied to the
data at hand.

This README will give you a tour of this folder and will walk you through how to reproduce
these analyses.
