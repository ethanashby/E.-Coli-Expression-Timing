This file includes next steps for future research, with code included as potential jumping-off points.

Mining UNIPROT Db and finding ways to integrate Rstudio with this Db more seamlessly
could be a direction of further research.

A major consideration here: we only focus on CDS sequences because we were particularly
interested in the timing of expressions of genes. However, other genomic features such
as IGRs, ncRNAs, etc that are highly differentially expressed could also be of interest.
We suggest this as a potential route of further research.
